# ZK Cooperative Governance

A privacy-preserving voting and governance platform for African cooperatives (SACCOs / DAOs) built on the Scroll ZKP ecosystem.

## Problem
Cooperatives and community funds suffer from vote manipulation, low trust, and lack of transparency.

## Solution
Members vote privately using zero-knowledge proofs while ensuring:
- One-member-one-vote
- Verifiable results
- No exposure of individual choices

## Why Scroll
Scroll enables low-cost, scalable governance with ZK verification on Ethereum-compatible infrastructure.
